REQUIRED LIBRARIES ---------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have pulp, numpy and random

GRAPH REPRESENTATION -------------------------------------------------------------------
the graphes are represented with strings as follows:
    - 1st line is k, capacity of each clusters
    - 2nd line is l, number of clusters
    - then each line represent a cluster. Each integer on this line is the size of a component that is contained in the cluster

for exemple, the graph:
    1st cluster : components of sizes 8 and 4
    2nd cluster : components of sizes 8 and 4
    3rd cluster : twelve components of sizes 1
has this representation:
12
3
4 8
4 8
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

HOW TO RUN IT -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
run evaluation/test.py
before that, you can change the inputs:
    - to indicate on what graph should the algo work, give graph_file_address the address of a graph with the above conventions
    - to indicate what components must merge together, give to component1 and component2 the indexes of the components who must merge.
      How do we find the index ? From left to right, from above to below, count the components starting from 0.
      For exemple on the graph above, the 4 on the 1st cluster has index 0, the 8 on the 2nd cluster has index 3
